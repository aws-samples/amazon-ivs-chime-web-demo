**This project is intended for education purposes only and not for production usage.**

This is a serverless web application, leveraging [Amazon IVS](https://aws.amazon.com/ivs/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and [ChimeSDK](https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk). The web user interface is a [single page application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) built using [responsive web design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) frameworks and techniques, producing a native app-like experience tailored to the user's device.
The demo showcase how customers can use Chime SDK to implement a real-time room with audio and video capabilities where users can watch IVS Stream and chat. Users can enter their name, a room name, and a Playback URL to create a room.
Once in the room, they can share room's unique URL, which can be used by others to join said room. Settings modal shows user their Playback URL, they can change their active audio input/output device and video input device.
There are controls to manage audio, video, a row of cams, a chat, and an option to leave the room.
